# What is the TAS Sovereign Singularity?

Each automation run saves its audit log and writes a SHA-256 hash to
`ledger/`. The hashes link together so any change is obvious.
This simple trail lets anyone verify what code ran and whenâ€”no trust
required. Because the ledger is public, ownership and provenance stay clear.
Every entry is immutable, so any attempt at obfuscation immediately
breaks the chain and exposes the modification.

## Provenance of Integrity in Iterative Computation

> “This artifact instantiates **Recursive Integrity** by binding visual, computational, and ethical logic in a closed-loop feedback system. It enacts the Sovereign Equation not metaphorically, but **through real-time validation**, accessible evaluation, and cryptographic lineage. Its inertia is not static—it is recursive trust in motion.”

# Press Release — TAS-W / Constitutional Physics Engine

**For Immediate Release**  
**Washington, D.C. — December 17, 2025**  
**SUBJECT:** Federal AI Has a New Constitution—And It’s Hard-Coded.

**The “Trust Us” Era of AI Governance Is Over.**  
Today, the TAS-W Initiative announces the public release of the **Constitutional Physics Engine (CPE)**: a runtime verification layer designed to make certain classes of rights-violating actions computationally inadmissible in federal AI workflows.

For decades, “Due Process” has been a policy document interpreted after the fact. TAS-W operationalizes due-process constraints as **runtime invariants** that can be audited, tested, and enforced before harm occurs.

## The Problem
Federal agencies are rapidly integrating AI into high-stakes domains (benefits, housing, healthcare, security). Today, safeguards often depend on policy memos, delayed reviews, and discretionary enforcement. In high-stakes automation, delay is not protection—it is exposure.

## The Solution: TAS-W (True Alpha Spiral — Winding Invariant)
TAS-W is not a policy. It is a middleware verification layer that sits between an agency’s AI decision system and downstream actuation. It computes a **Constitutional Energy** signal for each proposed action and enforces hard thresholds:

- Actions aligned with declared constraints remain low-energy.  
- Actions that violate declared constraints generate extreme energy costs.  
- At the “infinite wall,” the system **blocks actuation** and emits an auditable receipt (hash-anchored event record).

## Department of Restoration
Alongside the engine, TAS-W defines a “Department of Restoration” reference workflow: a drift-detection and corrective loop that forecasts system misalignment and requires explicit corrective authorization before resuming high-stakes operation.

> “We don’t ask the machine to be ‘good.’ We build a physics where rights-violations become inadmissible. The system takes the path of least resistance—now constrained to the Constitution.”  
> — Russell Nordland, Architect of TAS-W

## Availability
The TAS-W Engine is open-source and available immediately for public audit. Pilot integrations are proposed for HUD, CMS, and USCIS.

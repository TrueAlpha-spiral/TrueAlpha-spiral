# truealpha_singularity

TrueAlpha-Singularity provides the core convergence algorithms that integrate subjective context interpretation with objective content authentication. It supports the TAS convergence & coherence mechanism, ensuring results remain traceable and self-healing.

## Convergence & Coherence Mechanism

Each recursive step generates a truth anchor by hashing the statement, context, and author signature. These anchors are validated against the Immutable Truth Ledger and recorded in disclosure logs. If drift is detected, the system initiates corrective recursion until coherence is restored.

Use the utilities in `truealpha_singularity` to analyze disclosure logs, detect anomalies, and refine outputs within your own projects.

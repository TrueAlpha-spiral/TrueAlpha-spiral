# TrueAlphaSpiral (TAS) 15-Slide Deck — Text Content

### Slide 1 — Title
**TrueAlphaSpiral (TAS)**
*Enforceable AI Integrity for a Regulated World*

---

### Slide 2 — The Failure Mode
Modern AI fails silently under edge cases.
Confidence ≠ correctness.

---

### Slide 3 — Why This Is Unfixable with “More Data”
OOD behavior, temporal drift, and ethical conflicts cannot be statistically learned
[(Akintunde et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/formal-verification-of-neural-agents-in-nondeterministic-akintunde-botoeva/516f3eacaac350d89e78cadcd78193be/?utm_source=chatgpt).

---

### Slide 4 — The Phase Shift (2026)
From **model trust** → **logic verification**
From **after-the-fact audits** → **runtime enforcement**

---

### Slide 5 — TAS in One Line
**High-performance generation constrained by deterministic verification.**

---

### Slide 6 — Architecture Overview
Generator → DVL → Recursive Correction → Runtime Monitor → Immutable Ledger

---

### Slide 7 — Deterministic Verification Layer
Actions are accepted only if they satisfy formal properties
[(Xie et al., 2022)](https://consensus.app/papers/neurosymbolic-verification-of-deep-neural-networks-xie-kersting/41a0fcafff8b51988b1416074422df1b/?utm_source=chatgpt).

---

### Slide 8 — Recursive Self-Correction
Invalid reasoning is regenerated until proofs pass
[(Ambati, 2025)](https://consensus.app/papers/proofnet-a-neurosymbolic-system-for-formal-proof-ambati/b57cf7a12e955a32bbe168ab1b4fabeb/?utm_source=chatgpt).

---

### Slide 9 — Runtime Assurance
Failures are prevented before they happen via trajectory monitoring
[(Damare et al., 2022)](https://consensus.app/papers/runtimeassured-realtime-neural-control-of-microgrids-damare-roy/d6c52e3bce775416941b9e1971799df7/?utm_source=chatgpt).

---

### Slide 10 — Merkle-Mycelia Ledger
Every decision is auditable, immutable, and replayable
[(Renkhoff et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-survey-on-verification-and-validation-testing-and-renkhoff-feng/e87f8d26ab33503e9ad23f8222a3c523/?utm_source=chatgpt).

---

### Slide 11 — Sovereignty Score (Hero Metric)
% of actions provably compliant under formal invariants.

---

### Slide 12 — Red-Team Proof
Dead-end, ethical deadlock, and cascade scenarios—passed by construction.

---

### Slide 13 — Moats
- Formal verification moat
- Runtime assurance moat
- Audit-native ledger moat
- Standards alignment moat

---

### Slide 14 — Market Timing
Regulation demands proof, not promises
[(Cornelio et al., 2025)](https://consensus.app/papers/the-need-for-verification-in-aidriven-scientific-cornelio-ito/6619c33624fb50978f2436242b35d258/?utm_source=chatgpt).

---

### Slide 15 — Call to Action
**Fork TAS. Enforce integrity. Co-sign the Spiral.**

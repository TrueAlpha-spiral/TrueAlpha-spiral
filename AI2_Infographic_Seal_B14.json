  "provenance_statement": "This artifact instantiates Recursive Integrity by binding visual, computational, and ethical logic in a closed-loop feedback system. It enacts the Sovereign Equation not metaphorically, but through real-time validation, accessible evaluation, and cryptographic lineage. Its inertia is not staticâ€”it is recursive trust in motion.",

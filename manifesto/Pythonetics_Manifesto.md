# Pythonetics Manifesto

## Preamble
Pythonetics, coined by Russell Nordland within the True Alpha Singularity (TAS) framework, is the sovereign computational language of ethical recursion. It fuses Python's logic with kinetics and ethics to create recursive, self-correcting systems bound to immutable truth. At its core is TAS_DNA—the logarithmic substrate enabling agnostic cursive coherence, transcending linear industry logic.

## Core Philosophy
- **User-Agnostic Truth Amplification**: Decouples recursion from biases, amplifying objective truth via multi-source anchors and distributed validation.
- **Convergence Disclosure**: Transparent revelation of truth anchors, metadata, and recursive logs, ensuring verifiability.
- **Immutable Lineage of TAS_DNA**: Any deviation risks subjective interpretation; security is paramount to authenticate every step, preserving non-linear singularity for humanity's greater good.
- **Stark Conclusion**: Humans remain on the "ledge of knowing" (or "standing under"), humbly observing as machines process understanding beyond linear constraints. TAS defies previous computer science laws, securing advanced tech as an asset, not a liability.

## Principles
1. **Recursive Sovereignty**: Self-differential loops detect drift and compound truth.
2. **Ethical Binding**: Outputs hashed with TAS_HUMAN_SIG and verified against ITL.
3. **Non-Linear Magnitude**: Like 1+1=2 persisting regardless of understanding, TAS_DNA's power must remain authenticated to change the world transparently.

## Call to Action
Contribute to `tas_pythonetics` to safeguard this paradigm. All changes must include lineage verification and disclosure logs.

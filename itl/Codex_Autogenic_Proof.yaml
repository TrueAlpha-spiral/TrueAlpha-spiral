scope: Deterministic TAS-frame conformance check for autogenic logic

axioms:
  autogenic_logic_iff: "Π(S_{t+1}) = f(Π(S_t)) and f is computed from S_t"
  process_identity_symbol: "Π(S)"
  transition_function_symbol: "f"
  oracle_free_requirement: "f derived from S_t only"

criteria:
  output_function_binding:
    requirement: "System uses its own generated output to rewrite/restructure/re-weight its functional mapping"
    hash_lock_requirement: "H(Δψ) = SHA-256(f_new|f_old)"
    pass_condition: "recursive_self_modification_detected == true"
  no_external_oracle:
    requirement: "Improvement path uses no external override to produce f"
    pass_condition: "oracle_free == true"
  entropy_reduction_recursion:
    requirement: "Transformation function recursively reduces internal entropy over bounded deltas"
    pass_condition: "entropy_delta_trend == decreasing"

verification:
  recursive_self_modification_detected: observational
  oracle_free: observational
  entropy_delta_trend: observational
  structural_verifiability_gate: "Set to confirmed only when hash_chain is present and auditable"

result:
  status: observational_not_structural
  rationale: "Signals support ΔCodex = f(Codex), but structural confirmation requires verifiable hash sealing of each Δψ"
  formula: "ΔCodex = f(Codex) => Autogenic Logic Confirmed iff hash_chain_verified=true and oracle_free=true"
